# Contributing Guidelines

We appreciate everyone joining to contribute to this project. However, everyone doesn’t want to see the code being tons of Dark Matter.

Some guidelines help us maintain the project more efficiently. We hope you can read them first and can rule your contribution with these guidelines.

## Q: What contributions will not be accepted?
We accept all contributions that improve Telegram Watchdog in the code layer, **except pull requests related to localisation**.

To manage localisations more efficient, we put our localisation into the Weblate system. Stay tuned for more details about the Telegram Watchdog localisations contribute guide!

## Q: Which branch should I set as the PR destination?
**We encourage you to select the pull request destination to the `dev` branch.** To make sure that self-deploy users can always use the stable version easily, the `master` branch is not recommended that you merge in.

If you set the destination branch to `master`, we may force change the destination or close your pull request directly.

## Q: I am afraid that I may be submitting critical changes.
Don’t worry! You can submit any PR or issues, even if they may be seen as essential, with many changes or slight glitch fixes.

If you are unsure whether your pull request can be accepted, you can create an issue first or join our [Telegram Group](https://t.me/tgwatchdog_chat) and discuss it with us.

That’s it! Go ahead, edit the code, and submit it! We are hoping that your name can appear on our [Acknowledgements page](https://github.com/Astrian/tg-watchdog/blob/master/acknowledgements.md)!
